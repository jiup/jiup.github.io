### [Ecom backend system](https://github.com/jiup/ecom)

###### Nov 2017 – Apr 2018

A customized e-commerce backend system I built used [Spring4](https://spring.io/). Its RESTful API documentation was rendered by SwaggerUI. I've customized the BotDetect captcha toolkit and extended some Spring annotations for simpler identity validation.

### [G&C | Visualized Web Crawler Suite](https://github.com/jiup/chollima)

###### Dec 2016 – Jun 2017

A B/S program helps people to extract formatted web content without coding. It was built on top of my crawler library – [Gospy](https://github.com/jiup/gospy) and is quite easy to extend for it's fully modulized design. It's no more a messy job to do scheduler configuration, cross-node collaboration, and anonymous crawling. I designed the front-end myself and built it as a single page application. It even has multiple themes :-)

### [Delta | Light-weight Web MVC Framework](https://github.com/zhangjiupeng/delta)

###### Nov 2015 – Jan 2016

My very first try to design and implement some sort of "framework". This project armed my object-oriented programming skills(e.g. Java reflection, annotations, dynamic proxies, and XML/DTD parsing), and helped me construct a deeper understanding of Structs/Spring framework families when figuring out my code design hence it deserves to be listed here.

Actually this was not expected to be a real-life utility, but through this self-driven experience, I've learned a lot from source code reading, design patterns practice and abstraction trade-offs...
